	Clarity: Starting with test makes it clear that the method is a test case.
	Framework Compatibility: Many testing frameworks recognize methods prefixed with test as test cases automatically.

	Alternative Naming Conventions: Consider behavior-driven naming (e.g., should<ExpectedBehavior>) or descriptive names for better clarity.
	Consistency is Key: Choose a naming convention that aligns with your teamâ€™s standards and apply it consistently across all test cases.
